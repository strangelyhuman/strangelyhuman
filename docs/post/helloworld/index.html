<h2 id="hi">Hi</h2>

<p>First things first, A Happy new year! I figured I would make a resolution that could easily be fulfilled
and voila!- this blog was formed!</p>

<p>I have been meaning to move away from Wordpress and Tumblr because I wanted more control over my content
without having to navigate through the maze of menus and plugins. To that end, I have been working on
a nice side project - building a blog. I think its a nice exercise because you get to think about how you would
want to design and structure the site.</p>

<p>Except that I have been really starved of time(courtesy: Work) and I really needed something up while that was being
worked on.</p>

<p>Enter Hugo. It&rsquo;s a static site generator which lets you get a site up without much hassle.
And if you like your site structured around posts, then it&rsquo;s perfect.</p>

<p>So for the time being, this will be the place where I write about the things/experiments that I am doing. I think
its going to be a learning experience as I experiment with Hugo and I hope that the subjects I write about will
foster some amount of thought and discussion.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be writing more. That&rsquo;s it for the first post.</p>

<p>Ciao for now!</p>
