      <description>Just wanted to give you a general sense of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing. In fact, I think its all over the place. A couple of years back, I found the adjective that&amp;rsquo;s an apt description of the situation I am in- Dilettantism.
A person who dabbles in a lot of things without really being serious about any one thing.
While the adjective is meant to be pejorative, I often take some pride in the fact that I dabble in a lot of things- It&amp;rsquo;s just that I find all the things that I am doing equally interesting and I like devoting a fair share of time to them all, without letting go of anything that I&amp;rsquo;ve started.</description>
