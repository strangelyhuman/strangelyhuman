I graduated from San Jose State University with a Master's degree in Computer Engineering with a specialization in Embedded Systems. Apart from what I've studied,
I am also passionate about a lot of things- I like reading about Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Game Design and World Culture. I made this blog so that I can
write about the sort of things that I find interesting.

Thanks for popping in!
