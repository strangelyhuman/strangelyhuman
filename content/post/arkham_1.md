### Foreword
Confession: I like playing video games. And its an area that I am very keen on getting into ever since I was a kid (well, I wanted to find Atlantis when I was a kid,
  But I figure this is realistic, yes?). Video games are sometimes misjudged for being a gateway for instant gratification, and while it can also be that, I think
  it undersells what the medium is actually capable of.

  I think video games are incredible devices for storytelling. And when many people come together with their passions for telling stories, combining art styles or building
  weird worlds, magic happens! To that end, I decided to write about the sort of experiences I have when I play a video game. I think that sort of exposition will not only
  help you appreciate the tinier details, but will also help me a lot when it comes to building my own game.

  I call this set of writings as *The Introspective Gamer*
