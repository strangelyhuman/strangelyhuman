Just wanted to give you a general sense of the things I've been doing. In fact, I think its all over the place.
A couple of years back, I found the adjective that's an apt description of the situation I am in- *Dilettantism*.

A person who dabbles in a lot of things without really being serious about any one thing.

While the adjective is meant to be pejorative, I often take some pride in the fact that I dabble in a lot of things-
It's just that I find all the things that I am doing equally interesting and I like devoting a fair share of time to
them all, without letting go of anything that I've started. And if that somehow leads to it being called to Dilettantism,
then I think it's cool.

I started using Illustrator/Designer to start sketching comics about living with Roommates and dealing with the various
idiosyncracies that comes with living with people from different backgrounds and ideas. Inspired by comics like **Cyanide and Happiness** and
**Lunarbabboon**, I called it **Roomies & Limbo**. Of course, with my coursework getting hectic and me going through a
emo phase (believe me when I tell you, I thought I was done with that!), some of those ideas have been in something of a limbo themselves.
I am happy to say that I have been able to devote some time to them. You should be able to see some of them in the next few weeks.

I have also been working on modifying the theme on the Hugo site. I have been using a lot of Designer to make SVGs (Scalable Vector Graphics, more on that later)
and I chanced upon this JS library called Anime JS which I think looks awesome. So its an opportunity for me to add a little bit of
flair to a pretty bland website. Nothing too fancy, but I think some amount of animation can help tell a story. So there's that.

I have also been fascinated with the works of the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. He has this really distinct way of handling a camera
to make incredibly long tracking shots. You can watch Birdman and The Revenant (which I think is his bloody best work till date).
Observing how he and visionaries like Roger Deakins plan their scenes is incredible.

And as always, I have been playing around with OpenCV. I think this needs a separate set of dedicated posts which will probably help
me reinforce the theory as I explain the functions I am working with. OpenCV is a rad library! If you are familiar with C++ and some
Image Processing theory, then you can be up and running in no time!

That's it for the update. Keep an eye out on this space! Cheerio!
