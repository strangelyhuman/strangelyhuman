## Hi

First things first, A Happy new year! I figured I would make a resolution that could easily be fulfilled
and voila!- this blog was formed!

I have been meaning to move away from Wordpress and Tumblr because I wanted more control over my content
without having to navigate through the maze of menus and plugins. To that end, I have been working on
a nice side project - building a blog. I think its a nice exercise because you get to think about how you would
want to design and structure the site.

Except that I have been really starved of time(courtesy: Work) and I really needed something up while that was being
worked on.

Enter Hugo. It's a static site generator which lets you get a site up without much hassle.
And if you like your site structured around posts, then it's perfect.

So for the time being, this will be the place where I write about the things/experiments that I am doing. I think
its going to be a learning experience as I experiment with Hugo and I hope that the subjects I write about will
foster some amount of thought and discussion.

I'll be writing more. That's it for the first post.

Ciao for now!
